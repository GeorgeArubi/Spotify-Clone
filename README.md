# Spotify Clone
<hr />
This application is a Spotify clone demo, it was built using the create-react-app CLI and the Spotify Web API. I created this application to get more familiar with React and also calling APIS. The app is meant to work in conjunction with an authorization/authenication server found at this repo.
