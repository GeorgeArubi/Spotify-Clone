# Spotify Clone
This application is a Spotify clone demo, it was built using the create-react-app CLI and the Spotify Web API. I created this application to get more familiar with React and also calling APIS. There are other features I would like to implement in this application, like the Spotify Web Playback SDK for instance -- so, stay tuned!
