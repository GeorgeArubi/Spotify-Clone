# Spotify Clone
This application is a Spotify clone demo, it was built using the create-react-app CLI and the Spotify Web API. I created this application to get more familiar with React and also calling APIS. There are other features I would like to implement in this application, like the Spotify Web Playback SDK and other components of the [Spotify Web Player](https://open.spotify.com/) -- so, stay tuned!

## Description
Starting with the login page, the application handles user authentication with the help of the Spotify API and an authentication token. React Context was used to store the token and handle user data -- this was a shorthand solution that allowed the app to share data globally wihtout the need for deep traversals in the component tree.
